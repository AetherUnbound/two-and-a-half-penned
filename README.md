# Two and a Half Penned
## A project to immortalize the man, the myth, the Twitter legend, Charlie Sheen

### Project Overview
Charlie Sheen is well known on Twitter for writing odd, esoteric, haiku-like tweets. We wanted to take these tweets and transform them into what they should be: art. Our ideal vision will have these major components:
 1. Twitter API queries to Charlie Sheen's tweets
 2. "Content Slider" to determine how much of a tweet, or how many tweets, are pulled in each request
 3. Tweet display that will present the tweet in a meaningful fashion
 4. Text-to-speech component that will read of the tweets/partial tweets as they are pulled
The latter two will involve physical components, and as such will only be pursued after (1) and (2) are completed. [Matthew Bowden](https://github.com/AetherUnbound) will mainly be contributing to the coding portion of this project, while [Logan Pendergrass](https://github.com/ljpendergrass) will be directing the artistic portion.

### Code Overview
Major code components/requirements will include the following:
 - Twitter bot to use API in querying Mr. Sheen's tweets
 - 'slider' to determine how much content to pulled
 - time based and/or input based querying
 - output to physical display device (Rasberry Pi, potentially model Zero, attached to a screen)
 - text-to-speech component to read the tweets as they are queried
 
Python is our initial attack language, although other languages may be used as necessary.
